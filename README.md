## Canadian trawl survey data in ICES DATRAS (March 04 2020 draft)

The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ([ICES](http://ices.dk)) is the world's oldest international scientific organisation. The mission of ICES is “to advance the scientific understanding of marine ecosystems, and provide information, knowledge, and advice on the sustainable management of human activities affecting, and affected by, marine ecosystems”.  ICES member states collaborate to provide advice on the sustainable use of the oceans including fisheries conservation and management.

An essential component of any stock assessment is the data from fisheries-independent at-sea surveys.  Bottom-trawl surveys are conducted by a number of countries and often provide the most reliable source of information about the biology and dynamics of marine populations. ICES has been instrumental in developing a centralised database facilitating the sharing of trawl survey information between nations (i.e. [DATRAS](http://datras.ices.dk/), the DATabase of TRAwl Surveys). The imposition of standards for the data hosted by the DATRAS has allowed ICES to develop a series of analytical tools meant to support stock assessment by facilitating data discovery, extractions and analyses.

Canada conducts a number of trawl surveys and the Fisheries Science Data Integration Group, as directed by ICES Science Committee (SCICOM)  and Advisory Committee (ACOM) Canadian delegates, has initiated the sharing of these data with ICES DATRAS.  As each DFO region is in charge of its own survey program, the modalities of data capture, storage and management varies from region to region. The initial step to publishing Canadian trawl survey data to ICES DATRAS was to start with sharing trawl survey information from two regions (Maritimes and Gulf) that share similar data storage solutions.

The details of the steps required to produce the DATRAS-compliant version of trawl surveys is documented in this GitHub repository.

The next steps of this initiative forward are as follows:
1 - demonstrate the ability to use the DATRAS version of data to compute biomass and abundance indices for a subset of species
2 - expand the Canadian surveys made available to DATRAS
